# Different kinds of notes

You want to filter the most important things fo to the top.

The key is multiple passes and questioning "what are the things that I think is important and cool?"

Notes and notebooks don't need to be structural, they can contain anything.

## The different passes:

1: Write down stuff
2: Circle things that you like.
3: Highlight the things that you still like.

## Create a index
Number the right side pages and create a index in the beginning of the notebook so it is easy to find good notes later.

## Exercise:
"What is the top craziest things I can to to levitate stress" - Write down everything idea that's comes up in your mind.

The point is to come up with crazy ideas, bad, upsurge and out of all you will find one that is good or is a seed for a good idea.
