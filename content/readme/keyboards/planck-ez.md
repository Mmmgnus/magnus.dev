## Ideas
Some ideas I have on improving the key mapping of my Planck EZ keyboard.

### Move ENTER key to a layer
Planck only support one size of keys. So enter, shift, tab, all have the same size. This makes it a bit hard for me to hit the correct key for enter with my pinky. And I don't have any space for a dedicated right shift key, I solved this by making the enter key also the shift key. This turned out to be a bad idea, I need to be able to quickly click on the right shift to make a character capitalised. But often that click is registered as a ENTER key. And I need a right shift, only one for my left hand is not the way I want to do it.

So maybe I should move my enter key to a better spot in the keyboard that is easy to reach. But that also means that it needs to be on a layer. I'm thinking about putting the ENTER key on `RISE layer + U` because I use my left thumb for space, and making the left thumb handling both space and enter would make me slower. On a normal keyboard I have a hand handling space and the other hand handling the Enter key.

This would free up the right shift key to only do one thing, and that will speed me up.

### Add CMD + S to the lower layer.
Right now I have the normal; undo, cut, copy, paste, commands on the lower layer to make them easier to hit without moving my left thumb under my hand. A issue with is that ofter use the `Lower` layer key for other commands such as "Save".

I wonder if I should add the save command to the layer. I use that command a lot. But wouldn't this move my problem only forward and not really solve anything.

I have unused keys on the lower layer for the left hand, but I may want to use them for more special characters.

### Move =<> to the Lower layer
Most of the special characters is on my Lower layer. But some aren't and they are mostly the opposite of them on the `Lower` lever for example `_` and `-` is on the same key on different layers. The reason that `=<>` is on the `Rise` layer is that is often use them in combinations when coding. But it feels strange and disorienting to have all other paretics characters `(){}[]` on the Lower layer, and `<>` on the Rise layer.

I should move the `<>=` keys to the Lower layer on the home row for the left and. The issue I see is that the left hand is handling space and I will use the combinations `=> (` and `= {`  a lot the writing code. This will force me to move my left thumb to the space and then back to the `Lower` layer key. Having them on the `Rise` layer for the right thumb, will it be any different?

Should actually the `Rise` layer handling all the characters?
