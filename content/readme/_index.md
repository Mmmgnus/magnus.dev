This is not a log, blog or anything like that. This is only a place for me to store everything I have in my mind so I don't forget important things. Things like:

* What is the best way to implement SVG icons on a website?
* How do you create components in a modular way that is reuseable?
* What is the short-commands I use in all my apps and tools?
* How do I write readable code that doesn't smell?
* How do you write good documentations?
