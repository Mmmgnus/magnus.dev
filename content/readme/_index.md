draft: false
intro: "My collection of personal notes about my development journey in code and life; mostly in code."
---

This is not a log, blog or anything like that. This is only a place for me to store everything I have in my mind so I don't forget important things. Things like:

* What is the best way to implement SVG icons on a website?
* How do you create components in a modular way that is reuseable?
* What is the short-commands I use in all my apps and tools?
* How do I write readable code that doesn't smell?
* How do you write good documentations?

## The structure of this readme
*Sorry*, but this collection of knowleages is not well structured, maybe some day in the future but not right now. But I try to follow some structure and guidelines.

### Guidelines

#### Don't think to much about the structure
The most important is to write things down, if I don't know where I should put a piece of information or knowleage, just add it directly under [/readme]({{< ref "/readme" >}}). 

#### Links
Links are stored by topic, You find Javascript links under [/javascript]({{< ref "/readme/javascript" >}}), links about something related to React under [/javascript/react](/readme/javascript/react). If there is no page on the topic, the page should be created or the link should be stored in /links.

#### Problems & solutions
My goal is to log all my problem and what the solution was. Like links they are documented on the corespoding topic under the headline "Issues and solutions" or under a subpage with the same name listing all problems.

### Visual & typography convensions

#### Terminal input
Inputs that should be done in a terminal.
{{< terminal >}}
  mkdir my-project-name
{{< /terminal >}}
